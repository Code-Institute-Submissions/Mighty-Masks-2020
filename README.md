MIGHTY MASKS
This project showcases a fictious supplier (Mighty Masks) based around Shanghai seeking orders from big retailers and government agencies during the current pandemic.

I work in the fashion industry and believe suppliers could stand to benefit from better standards of presentation and communication that emphasises quality of product and a partner that can be trusted to deliver.  
In my regular job I negotiate and engage with suppliers based in The East on behalf of a Western company - I thought would offer an excellent challenge to take the opposite point of view.

UX
My UX is designed to appeal to the archetypal buyer or procurement manager. They are visually minded (wanting to see product and usage) but also cautious and keen to mitigate against risk. To win orders the team at Mighty Masks will need to make a positive impression, capture attention and entice the visitor into providing contact information which can later be followed up.

As a buyer or procurement type in the market for fashion or medical masks, I most want to understand what product is offered, how it is made and by whom, so that I can place orders for in demand stock with confidence. I am very wary of potential product quality and reputational issues.
I tried to model Mighty Masks on number of presentation ideas I came across when researching various supplier & online retailer websites. I sought to blend the factual informative style of the average supplier and the impressive presentation style the online retailer.
I've added my research & inspriration as a PDF.

Based on my initial research I then created a wireframes mock-up. This has been added too as a PDF.

Features
The project is divided into 5 sections with a number of features.

1. Home Page
Allows visitors to quickly evaluate MightyMasks product and reputation, offers a sign up link and form to subscribe to a newsletter. Encourages progression to "Get In Touch" page through hyperlinks.

2. Product Page
Allows visitors to quickly evaluate MightyMasks product and reputation, offers a sign up link. 

3. Our Mission Page
Allows visitors to quickly evaluate MightyMasks product and reputation, offers a sign up link. 

4. Our Values Page
Allows visitors to quickly evaluate MightyMasks product and reputation, offers a sign up link. 

5. Get In Touch Page
Allows visitors to quickly evaluate MightyMasks product and reputation, offers a sign up link. 

Features Left to Implement : 
Chat feature on the Home Page
Product carousel on the product page with options for colour and fabric selection.

Technologies Used : GitHub, GitPod
Languages : HTML, CSS
Tools :

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

Testing
I noticed speed load times were slow in Chrome Developer Tools. I initially resized all images from 5000KB to 1000-1500KB. Load time was still over 2s+ so I resized images a second time to 500KB or lower.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
